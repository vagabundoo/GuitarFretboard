### GuitarTrainer ConsoleApp

Simple project to get more experience in C#.   
The goal was to develop a console app that a user can use to memorize note names on the guitar fretboard.

The user gets a string name and fret number, and is prompted to give a letter note name (i.e. "Eb").  
The user then gets immediate feedback on whether the note was correct.
